# BotFit

BotFit, a simple messenger bot for the Reebok Crossfit Louvre box

## The why

The purpose of this project is to stay fit by easily handling the booking of WOD at the Reebok Crossfit Louvre box. The provided website sucks, that is why I decided to enhance the UX by providing a chatbot as an overlay.

I studied the API architecture of the original interface and managed to identify the important routes to perform the booking (or unbooking) of the WOD. Here is presented to you the humble result of many hours of investigations.
